Emfed: Simple Client-Side Mastodon Feed Embedding
=================================================

Twitter used to have a really convenient way to embed a feed into your website, but now Twitter is dead.
Emfed is a simple replacement for [Mastodon][] that works entirely in the browser, without a server-side component (beyond your favorite Mastodon instance itself).

To use it, put a special link like this where you want the feed to appear:

    <a class="mastodon-feed"
       href="https://mastodon.social/@Mastodon"
       data-toot-limit="4"
       >follow me into the Fediverse</a>

Then include the JavaScript (probably at the end of your `<body>`):

    <script type="module" src="https://esm.sh/emfed@1"></script>

Emfed generates some pretty basic markup for the feed.
You probably want to style it to look like a proper social media feed, which you can do with plain ol' CSS scoped to the `.toots` selector, or you can use its provided CSS (in your `<head>`):

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
          href="https://esm.sh/emfed@1/toots.css">

You can customize the feed with `data-` attributes:

* `data-toot-limit`: The maximum number of toots to display.
* `data-toot-account-id`: Emfed needs to make an extra API request to translate your human-readable username (like `@Mastodon`) into an internal ID (like 13179) before it can look up your toots. If you have [empathy for the machine][eftm], you can make everything faster by specifying the ID directly here.
* `data-exclude-replies`: "true" or "false" according to whether or not you'd like to exclude replies. The default behavior is that replies are included.
* `data-exclude-self-replies`: "true" or "false" according to whether or not you'd like to exclude replies to its own account. The default behavior is that replies are included. This is a workaround for https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/23257 as that won't be fixed. If self-replies get filtered out, the amount of displayed toots is reduced.
* `data-exclude-reblogs`: "true" or "false" according to whether or not you'd like to exclude reblogs/boosts. The default behavior is that reblogs/boosts are included.

You can customize how the feed is rendered with further `data-` attributes:

* `data-locale`: Locale to render the date of each toot. The default behavior is that the webbrowsers locale will be taken. Should that not be available, `en-US` will be used as a fallback.
* `data-ts_format`: JSON object to define how to render the date. The default object is `'{"month": "long", "day": "numeric"}'`. Please be sure to use double quotes within the JSON string.

Emfed sanitizes the HTML contents of toots using [DOMPurify][] to avoid malicious markup and XSS attacks.

Embed a Post and Its Replies
----------------------------

You can also embed an individual post, the replies to a post, or both.
This mode lets you use Fediverse replies as a comment system for static sites, inspired by [a blog post from Carl Schwan][reply-post].

Use this to embed a post along with its responses:

    <a class="mastodon-thread"
       href="https://mastodon.social/@Mastodon"
       data-toot-id="112011697087209298"
       >Thread from the Fediverse</a>

By default, both the original post and the replies appear.
You can customize this link with `data-` attributes:

* `data-exclude-replies`: Set to `true` to exclude the replies.
* `data-exclude-post`: Set to `true` to exclude the post, leaving just the replies. This may be more appropriate for the blog-comments use case [mentioned above][reply-post].

This mode uses the same style of markup as the user feed, so you can use the same CSS to provide style for these embedded posts.

Hacking
-------

Type `make dev` to serve an example page.

Some missing features you might be interested in contributing include rendering media beyond static images (GIFs, videos, and audio), using a [BlurHash][] placeholder before media has loaded, and optionally filtering out replies or boosts.

Alternatives
------------

* [Mastofeed](https://www.mastofeed.com): A server-side iframe-embeddable feed generator.
* [Fedifeed](https://fedifeed.com): Like Mastofeed, but for other ActivityPub software too.
* [Mastodon embed timeline from idotj](https://gitlab.com/idotj/mastodon-embed-timeline): Also client-side. I wanted something with secure HTML embedding, automatic username lookup, and simpler URL-based configuration.

Changelog
---------

* v1.6.0: A new `data-exclude-reblogs` config option for hiding boosts.
* v1.5.0: Add a mode to embed a single post and its replies.
* v1.4.2: Switch to a more "normal" build process.
* v1.4.1: Fix npm publication.
* v1.4.0: Split into multiple submodules, which also lets you avoid automatic transformation.
* v1.3.0: Drop the dependency on [Mustache][]. Fix a bug where, on some browsers, the `data-*` attributes would not work (so we'd always use the default configuration).
* v1.2.0: Display image attachments.
* v1.1.0: Display boosts (reblogs) correctly.
* v1.0.1: Fix an incorrect URL when `data-toot-account-id` is not provided.
* v1.0.0: Initial release.
