Emfed: Simple Client-Side Mastodon Feed Embedding
=================================================

Twitter used to have a really convenient way to embed a feed into your website, but now Twitter is dead.
Emfed is a simple replacement for [Mastodon][] that works entirely in the browser, without a server-side component (beyond your favorite Mastodon instance itself).

To use it, put a special link like this where you want the feed to appear:

    <a class="mastodon-feed"
       href="https://mastodon.social/@Mastodon"
       data-toot-limit="4"
       >follow me into the Fediverse</a>

Then include the JavaScript (probably at the end of your `<body>`):

    <script type="module" src="https://esm.sh/emfed"></script>

Emfed generates some pretty basic markup for the feed.
You probably want to style it to look like a proper social media feed, which you can do with plain ol' CSS scoped to the `.toots` selector, or you can use its provided CSS (in your `<head>`):

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
          href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sampsyo/emfed@1/toots.css">

You can customize the feed with `data-` attributes:

* `data-toot-limit`: The maximum number of toots to display.
* `data-toot-account-id`: Emfed needs to make an extra API request to translate your human-readable username (like `@Mastodon`) into an internal ID (like 13179) before it can look up your toots. If you have [empathy for the machine][eftm], you can make everything faster by specifying the ID directly here.
* `data-exclude-replies`: "true" or "false" according to whether or not you'd like to exclude replies. The default behavior is that replies are included.

Emfed sanitizes the HTML contents of toots using [DOMPurify][] to avoid malicious markup and XSS attacks.

Using via the API
-----------------

By default, Emfed automatically transforms all the special Mastodon links it finds on the page.
You can also instead invoke it programmatically, in which case you will want to instruct it not to automatically transform anything:

    import { loadToots } from "emfed?auto=off";
    document.querySelectorAll(".my-feed-class").forEach(loadToots);

Use the `?auto=off` URL parameter to disable the automatic behavior.
Then, call the `loadToots` function on any element to replace it with a Mastodon feed as described above.

Hacking
-------

An easy way to work with the code is with the [Packup][] bundler for [Deno][].
Type `make dev` to serve an example page.

Some missing features you might be interested in contributing include rendering media beyond static images (GIFs, videos, and audio), using a [BlurHash][] placeholder before media has loaded, and optionally filtering out replies or boosts.

Alternatives
------------

* [Mastofeed](https://www.mastofeed.com): A server-side iframe-embeddable feed generator.
* [Fedifeed](https://fedifeed.com): Like Mastofeed, but for other ActivityPub software too.
* [untitled embed script from idotj](https://gitlab.com/idotj/mastodon-embed-feed-timeline): Also client-side. I wanted something with secure HTML embedding, automatic username lookup, and simpler URL-based configuration.

Changelog
---------

* v1.3.0: Drop the dependency on [Mustache][]. Fix a bug where, on some browsers, the `data-*` attributes would not work (so we'd always use the default configuration).
* v1.2.0: Display image attachments.
* v1.1.0: Display boosts (reblogs) correctly.
* v1.0.1: Fix an incorrect URL when `data-toot-account-id` is not provided.
* v1.0.0: Initial release.
